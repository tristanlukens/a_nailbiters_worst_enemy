# A nailbiter's worst enemey

Website that keeps track of how many days you haven't bit your nails. Because it's bad for you, your health and the overall look of your hands.

## Roadmap

Here I'll list features that I want to implement to reach a particular version. The app's on version 0.1 at the time of writing.

## Version 0.2

-   [x] ~~all the graphql requests should be located in a seperate module (instead of everywhere in server files), because it's a little ðŸ’¦ like this~~
-   [x] user authentication works well (with error messages and everything)
-   [x] passwords are hashed
-   [x] the sign up page has an actual page and a form

The request code seperation is _een zorg voor later_

Update 20 minutes later: I fucking did succeed in the whole splitting up thing! Turns out the _zorg voor later_ ain't so much a _zorg voor later_ no more

## Version 0.3

-   [x] user can use sign up page to create an account
-   [ ] ~~user can click an "i forgor ðŸ’€" button for their password and email~~\*
-   [ ] ~~everything works with the user type~~\*\*
-   [x] there should be a remember me button on the fucking register page
-   [x] the pronoun dropdown menu looks terrible on safari
-   [x] metadata (s-head)

\*scrapped â€” users can go fuck themselves if they forget their credentials
\*\*pushed to 0.4 in the cleanup stage

## Version 0.4

-   [ ] tab navigation on dropdown menu
-   [ ] all the code that has already been written is cleaned

## Version 0.5

-   [ ] account management page ui is done
-   [ ] account management page can be used
