# A nailbiter's worst enemey

Website that keeps track of how many days you haven't bit your nails. Because it's bad for you, your health and the overall look of your hands.

# Roadmap

Here I'll list features that I want to implement to reach a particular version. The app's on version 0.1 at the time of writing.

## Version 0.2

-   [x] ~~all the graphql requests should be located in a seperate module (instead of everywhere in server files), because it's a little 💦 like this~~
-   [x] user authentication works well (with error messages and everything)
-   [x] passwords are hashed
-   [x] the sign up page has an actual page and a form

The request code seperation is _een zorg voor later_

Update 20 minutes later: I fucking did succeed in the whole splitting up thing! Turns out the _zorg voor later_ ain't so much a _zorg voor later_ no more

## Version 0.3

-   [x] user can use sign up page to create an account
-   [ ] user can click an "i forgor 💀" button for their password and email
-   [ ] everything works with the user type
-   [ ] there should be a remember me button on the fucking register page
-   [ ] the pronoun dropdown menu looks terrible on safari
