# A nailbiter's worst enemey

Website that keeps track of how many days you haven't bit your nails. Because it's bad for you, your health and the overall look of your hands.

# Roadmap

Here I'll list features that I want to implement to reach a particular version. The app's on version 0.1 at the time of writing.

## Version 0.2

- [ ] all the graphql requests should be located in a seperate module (instead of everywhere in server files), because it's a little 💦 like this
- [ ] passwords are hashed
- [ ] the sign up page has an actual page and a form
